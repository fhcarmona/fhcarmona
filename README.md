# Introduction

Hello, I'm FÃ¡bio Henrique Carmona, Brazilian, graduate student in game development (Fatec Carapicuiba).

Trying to migrate from backend software development (programming since 2012~) to unity/unreal game development, so... if anyone is reading this, contact me in my email 'f.h.carmona@outlook.com', we can work together...

I'm trying to migrate to reach my initial goal (game development). My life guide is:

- Learn something each day;
- Show to everyone how interesting/fun science can be;
- Always trying to make the better from the worst.

Now, I can show some prints that I take in the passing years of development my personal game projects (none is done).
